Brief Description of Goal of Code:
The goal of this code is to create an HTML5 drawing canvas (with borders) that fits on a phone screen and has buttons that, when pressed, draws a rectangle on the canvas, puts my name on the canvas, loads an image of something onto the canvas, or clears the canvas.
